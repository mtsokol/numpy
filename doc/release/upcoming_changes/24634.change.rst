Renamed ``numpy/core`` to ``numpy/_core``
-----------------------------------------
``numpy/core`` is now officially a private module and access to it
in daily development is discouraged. To ensure backward compatibility,
``numpy/core`` is still present as a shim that emits
a ``DeprecationWarning`` on access.
